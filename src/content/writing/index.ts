Over the last few days, I've been "vibe coding" some ideas. Building quick prototypes without overthinking. What surprised me wasn't how fast I could move, but how easy it has become to build something that actually works. Thanks to AI, spinning up fully functional tools and products is no longer reserved for engineers with years of experience. It's now possible for someone like me, a designer with a decent grasp of CSS and layout to ship production-ready apps/tools.

## The New Reality of Building

This shift changes everything. When anyone can code, the barrier to entry drops to zero. The market floods with products that work well enough. Features that once took months can now be replicated in days. The technical moat disappears.

### What This Means for Builders

- Rapid prototyping has become accessible to everyone.
- AI tools enable non-engineers to create functional products.
- Designers can now ship production-ready applications with ease.
- The process is faster and more intuitive than ever before.

### The Design Advantage

But here's where design becomes the real differentiator. When everyone can build something functional, what makes people choose your product? It's the experience. The thoughtfulness. The way it feels. These are things AI can't easily replicate because they require taste, judgment, and a deep understanding of human behavior.

1. Understanding user psychology and behavior patterns
2. Creating emotional connections through thoughtful interactions
3. Making complex things feel simple and intuitive
4. Building trust through consistent, polished experiences

---

> Design is no longer just about making things pretty. It's about creating an experience so good that people choose your product even when alternatives exist.

## Building with Intention

The best products aren't just well-designed interfaces. They're well-designed systems that consider every touchpoint, every interaction, every moment of friction. They understand that design isn't decoration—it's the architecture of experience.

As AI makes building easier, design thinking becomes more valuable. Not just visual design, but product design. Service design. Experience design. The kind of design that asks "should we build this?" before "how do we build this?"

### The Path Forward

So if you're a designer who can code (or a coder learning design), you're in the perfect position. You can move fast *and* create something people actually want to use. You understand both the "what's possible" and the "what feels right."

The future belongs to builders who understand that in a world where anyone can make something that works, the real competitive advantage is making something that people **love**.

Real growth isn't about tricks or shortcuts. It's about building something people genuinely want and making it easy for them to tell others about it.

## The Problem with Growth Hacking

Growth hacking sounds sexy. Quick wins. Explosive growth. Viral loops. But here's the reality: most growth hacks don't work long-term. They're band-aids on a product that doesn't quite work yet.

### Why Hacks Fail

- They prioritize metrics over user value
- They create unsustainable expectations
- They attract the wrong users
- They burn out your team

## The Alternative: Product-Led Growth

Instead of chasing hacks, focus on making your product so good that people naturally want to share it. This is harder but more sustainable.

### What Makes People Share?

1. **The product solves a real problem** - Not a problem you invented, but one they actively feel
2. **It's delightfully easy to use** - No friction, no confusion, just works
3. **It makes them look good** - Sharing it makes them seem smart or helpful
4. **It saves them time or money** - Tangible value they can point to

---

> The best growth strategy is to build something people love and get out of their way.

## Build Distribution Into the Product

Think about how people discover and share your product naturally. Don't force it, enable it.

### Examples of Natural Distribution

When you build with [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io), your profile is public and shareable. We didn't need to add sharing buttons—people wanted to share because it made them look good. The product *is* the distribution channel.

The same with AutoSend. Every email sent includes subtle branding, but only if the sender wants it. It's opt-in, not forced. People keep it because they're proud of the product.

## Focus on Retention, Not Acquisition

New users mean nothing if they don't stick around. A product with 100 weekly active users who love it beats 10,000 one-time visitors who bounce.

### Retention Metrics That Matter

- Are people coming back?
- Are they using it more over time?
- Would they miss it if it was gone?
- Are they recommending it to others?

If the answer to these is "no," you don't have a distribution problem. You have a product problem.

## The Compound Effect

Sustainable growth feels slow at first. You're not going viral. You're not on the front page of everywhere. But you're building something real.

**Month 1**: 10 users who love your product  
**Month 2**: 25 users (10 stayed + 15 new)  
**Month 3**: 60 users (25 stayed + 35 new)  
**Month 6**: 500 users  
**Month 12**: 5,000 users  

This compounds. And unlike growth hacks, it keeps going.

### Building for the Long Term

The unsexy truth about growth:

1. Build something people want
2. Make it easy to use
3. Help people get value quickly
4. Listen to feedback and iterate
5. Be patient

There's no magic formula. No secret hack. Just consistent, focused work on making your product better every day.

---

## When to Think About Growth

Only after you have retention. If people aren't coming back, nothing else matters. Fix that first.

Once people are sticking around, once they're telling friends, *then* you can think about growth tactics. But even then, keep it simple:

- Write about what you're building
- Show up where your users hang out
- Make it easy to share
- Celebrate your community

The best marketing is a product people want to talk about. Everything else is noise.

The best products come from personal frustration. When you build something you actually need, you understand the problem deeply, you know what's missing, and you have the motivation to make it great.

## Build for Yourself First

Too many founders start with "what can I build that will make money?" instead of "what problem am I facing that needs solving?" The second question leads to better products because you're your own first user. You can test, iterate, and validate immediately.

### Why This Matters

- You understand the pain point intimately
- You can validate solutions instantly
- Your motivation stays high even when things get hard
- You know what "good enough" actually means

## The Power of Scratching Your Own Itch

When I started building [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io), it was because I was frustrated with existing portfolio platforms. They didn't capture what I needed as a designer and builder. So I made something that worked for me. Turns out, thousands of others had the same frustration.

> The most successful products often start as solutions to the founder's own problems. You're not guessing what users want—you ARE the user.

### Finding Your Itch

Pay attention to your daily frustrations. The things you wish existed. The tools that almost work but not quite. The processes that take too long. These are opportunities hiding in plain sight.

1. Notice what frustrates you repeatedly
2. Ask if others share this problem
3. Build the smallest thing that solves it
4. Use it yourself and improve it

---

## But What If I'm Not the Target Market?

This is a valid concern. You *can* build great products for users different from yourself. But it's harder. You need more research, more validation, more empathy work. And you're more likely to lose motivation when things get tough.

Starting with your own needs doesn't mean you can't expand to other users later. It just means you have a strong foundation to build from. A clear north star that keeps you honest about what matters.

### The Test

Ask yourself: Would I use this even if nobody else did? If the answer is yes, you're onto something. If no, you might be building for the wrong reasons.

The best products start small and personal. They solve real problems for real people—starting with you. Everything else is just noise.`;

I have been noticing a growing trend in designers spending a lot of time working on fictional case studies. Where they come up with an imaginary solution, for some imaginary problem. It's useless, mostly!

If you want to be a UI designer, go ahead and do that. No issues. But if you're training yourself to be a product designer—continue reading.
We all know how difficult the job market is right now. Layoff news coming in from all sides. Early stage companies are hiring, but very conservatively. And if it's a designer role, you need to be more than extraordinary to make a cut because of the cut-throat competition. Especially for the entry level roles.

I am writing this piece of advice for the newcomers. The ones who are looking for their first design job. Folks, you are competing with designers with 2-4 years of experience. And your fictional case studies won't help to "stand out".
This essay is not about how to design your portfolio, it's very specific about your proof-of-work as a product designer.

So, **what** will help you to be exceptional?

Work on real problems, build real solutions for real users!

Now you will ask **how**?

Many developers launch their [side projects on Peerlist](https://peerlist.io/projects?ref=designgiri.com). Many of them need help with design. (Sorry devs, but you really do!)

Connect with them. Convince them. Show them how your designs make their project super useful. Collaborate with them. This is important. Collaborate.

Now the most important question — **WHY**?

Well, they are building something which will be used by real people. Not millions, but hundreds for sure. Help them validate the problem. Help them design the solution. Help them improve the aesthetics. Collaborate with them!

Trust me, these developers will help you become a better designer. They will teach you what "technical constraints" are and tell you the real meaning of "edge cases".

Now document your learnings after collaborating on this side project. Present it as a case study. It's your proof-of-work which is highly credible! Your design is functional in an actual browser or an app. Not just a screenshot in a fancy free mockup.

Imagine you're sitting in an interview and discussing all your learnings while building this project. Telling stories about how a simple copy change improved the conversion from a landing page. Talking about user research, unexpected insights and how you convinced the developer to implement that fancy animation.

As a hiring manager, I will "hard relate" to these stories. Because you are not only talking only about the outcome but the actual impact of your design.

Just find a developer who is working on a side project or share that you're open to collaboration. You just need one or two such projects on your portfolio. I am sure a design manager will be interested in chatting with you.

Because you will stand out!

All the best!
