Real growth isn't about tricks or shortcuts. It's about building something people genuinely want and making it easy for them to tell others about it.

## The Problem with Growth Hacking

Growth hacking sounds sexy. Quick wins. Explosive growth. Viral loops. But here's the reality: most growth hacks don't work long-term. They're band-aids on a product that doesn't quite work yet.

### Why Hacks Fail

- They prioritize metrics over user value
- They create unsustainable expectations
- They attract the wrong users
- They burn out your team

## The Alternative: Product-Led Growth

Instead of chasing hacks, focus on making your product so good that people naturally want to share it. This is harder but more sustainable.

### What Makes People Share?

1. **The product solves a real problem** - Not a problem you invented, but one they actively feel
2. **It's delightfully easy to use** - No friction, no confusion, just works
3. **It makes them look good** - Sharing it makes them seem smart or helpful
4. **It saves them time or money** - Tangible value they can point to

## Build Distribution Into the Product

Think about how people discover and share your product naturally. Don't force it, enable it.

### Examples of Natural Distribution

When you build with [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io), your profile is public and shareable. We didn't need to add sharing buttons—people wanted to share because it made them look good. The product *is* the distribution channel.

The same with AutoSend. Every email sent includes subtle branding, but only if the sender wants it. It's opt-in, not forced. People keep it because they're proud of the product.

## Focus on Retention, Not Acquisition

New users mean nothing if they don't stick around. A product with 100 weekly active users who love it beats 10,000 one-time visitors who bounce.

### Retention Metrics That Matter

- Are people coming back?
- Are they using it more over time?
- Would they miss it if it was gone?
- Are they recommending it to others?

If the answer to these is "no," you don't have a distribution problem. You have a product problem.

## The Compound Effect

Sustainable growth feels slow at first. You're not going viral. You're not on the front page of everywhere. But you're building something real.

**Month 1**: 10 users who love your product  
**Month 2**: 25 users (10 stayed + 15 new)  
**Month 3**: 60 users (25 stayed + 35 new)  
**Month 6**: 500 users  
**Month 12**: 5,000 users  

This compounds. And unlike growth hacks, it keeps going.

### Building for the Long Term

The unsexy truth about growth:

1. Build something people want
2. Make it easy to use
3. Help people get value quickly
4. Listen to feedback and iterate
5. Be patient

There's no magic formula. No secret hack. Just consistent, focused work on making your product better every day.

## When to Think About Growth

Only after you have retention. If people aren't coming back, nothing else matters. Fix that first.

Once people are sticking around, once they're telling friends, *then* you can think about growth tactics. But even then, keep it simple:

- Write about what you're building
- Show up where your users hang out
- Make it easy to share
- Celebrate your community

The best marketing is a product people want to talk about. Everything else is noise.
