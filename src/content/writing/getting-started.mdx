# Getting Started with Design Systems

Design systems are the backbone of consistent, scalable digital products. They help teams work more efficiently and create better user experiences.

## What is a Design System?

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

## Getting Started

Here are the key steps to building your first design system:

- Define your design principles
- Create a color palette and typography scale
- Build component library
- Document everything
- Iterate and improve

## Best Practices

Start small and iterate. Don't try to build everything at once. Focus on the components you use most frequently and expand from there.
