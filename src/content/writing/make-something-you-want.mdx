We are builders. We always wants to build something. We have unlimited ideas. Which creates confusion. Confusion to the level that we end up building nothing!

Happens to every one of us where we can't decide on what to build. Maybe as a startup idea or even a simple side project.

I see a lot of posts on Peerlist as well, where people ask for ideas. My simple answer is always - build something you would use every day. This statement is not mine by the way. I read it, and it stuck with me.

Solve a simple problem for yourself. Be your own first user. It helps!

There are so many **[side projects](https://peerlist.io/launchpad)** launching on Peerlist every week. Most of the top projects are simple ideas with great execution solving a personal problem of that developer or designer. These side projects are the most loved ones. Because they are relatable.

When you build something for yourself, you are motivated to make it the best it can be. You know exactly what you need and what works for you. This personal touch makes your project more genuine and useful. Others who face the same problem will see the value in your solution.

Think about the tools and apps you use daily. Many of them started as small projects to solve a problem the creator faced. Gmail was created because the developers were frustrated with existing email services. Slack was built to solve communication issues within a team. These solutions were born out of necessity and grew into something much bigger.

By building something you would use, you create a strong foundation. Your passion and need drive you to keep improving it. You will find joy in using what you've built, and this satisfaction will fuel your drive to keep going.

So, the next time you're stuck on what to build, look inward. What problem do you face every day? What tool or service would make your life easier? Start there. Build it for yourself, and let others benefit from your solution.

In the end, the best projects come from a place of genuine need and personal experience. Build something you would use, and you'll find that others will want to use it too. Your simple, relatable solution might just become the next big thing.

Lastly - Here's Jack Dorsey on why building something for yourself can be better than trying to solve a problem.
