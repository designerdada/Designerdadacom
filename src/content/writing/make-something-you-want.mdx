The best products come from personal frustration. When you build something you actually need, you understand the problem deeply, you know what's missing, and you have the motivation to make it great.

## Build for Yourself First

Too many founders start with "what can I build that will make money?" instead of "what problem am I facing that needs solving?" The second question leads to better products because you're your own first user. You can test, iterate, and validate immediately.

### Why This Matters

- You understand the pain point intimately
- You can validate solutions instantly
- Your motivation stays high even when things get hard
- You know what "good enough" actually means

## The Power of Scratching Your Own Itch

When I started building [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io), it was because I was frustrated with existing portfolio platforms. They didn't capture what I needed as a designer and builder. So I made something that worked for me. Turns out, thousands of others had the same frustration.

> The most successful products often start as solutions to the founder's own problems. You're not guessing what users want—you ARE the user.

### Finding Your Itch

Pay attention to your daily frustrations. The things you wish existed. The tools that almost work but not quite. The processes that take too long. These are opportunities hiding in plain sight.

1. Notice what frustrates you repeatedly
2. Ask if others share this problem
3. Build the smallest thing that solves it
4. Use it yourself and improve it

## But What If I'm Not the Target Market?

This is a valid concern. You *can* build great products for users different from yourself. But it's harder. You need more research, more validation, more empathy work. And you're more likely to lose motivation when things get tough.

Starting with your own needs doesn't mean you can't expand to other users later. It just means you have a strong foundation to build from. A clear north star that keeps you honest about what matters.

### The Test

Ask yourself: Would I use this even if nobody else did? If the answer is yes, you're onto something. If no, you might be building for the wrong reasons.

The best products start small and personal. They solve real problems for real people—starting with you. Everything else is just noise.
