Minimalism in digital design is about removing the unnecessary to focus on what truly matters. It's not about making things sparse—it's about being intentional.

## Less is More

Every element in your design should serve a purpose. If it doesn't add value, it's taking away from the experience.

## Principles of Minimal Design

- Clear hierarchy and typography
- Generous white space
- Limited color palette
- Purposeful imagery
- Intuitive navigation

The goal is to create designs that are effortless to use and beautiful to look at.
